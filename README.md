- Opening the extension popup, right clicking in the popup and selecting "Inspect" to open the extension's developer tools.
- Selecting the Application tab and reviewing the extension local storage values.

## Translations
For translations, this extension uses [Chrome's i18n API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n). However, in place of the [i18n API's suggested folder structure](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n#support_multiple_languages) which requires several folders and files, translations for this project are stored in the `translations.json` file and get transformed into the necessary folder structure by the `generate_locales.py` script.

### Adding Translations
To add a translation, add it to the `translation.json` file. This file contains a JSON object with keys corresponding to an ID that can be used to lookup the message from the UI. The value of those keys are another object that has keys corresponding to the [i18n API's supported locales](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n#locales) with values of the translated message.

For example, to add a message with ID of "errorMessage" in both English (locale code `en`) and Spanish (locale code `es`):

```json
{
    "errorMessage": {
        "en": "Something went wrong.",
        "es": "Algo sali√≥ mal."
    }
}
```

### Generating Translations
After translations have been added, they must be generated for use in the extension. This can be done with the `generate_locales.py` script like this:

```bash
# Command
python3 generate_locales.py

# Output
Transforming locales

Writing locale file '_locales/en/messages.json'
Writing locale file '_locales/es/messages.json'

Finished transforming locales
```

### Using Translations
After generation, translations can be used directly in the `popup.html` file or via the i18n API in JavaScript.

#### Using Translations in `popup.html`
To use a translation in `popup.html`, add a `data-i18n-id` attribute to any element that can contain text and the value of that message ID will be inserted automaically.

```html
<p data-i18n-id="errorMessage"></p>
<!-- 
 Becomes: 
 <p data-i18n-id="errorMessage">Something went wrong!</p> 
-->
```

#### Using Translation via the Chrome i18n API
The automatic insertion of messages based on their ID is achieved by querying elements with the `data-i18n-id` attribute and setting their text to the result of `chrome.i18n.getMessage(element.dataset.i18nId)`:

```js
document.querySelectorAll("[data-i18n-id]").forEach( element => { 
    element.textContent = chrome.i18n.getMessage(element.dataset.i18nId)
})
```
